- Let $R$ be an [[Integral Domain|integral domain]], and $p\in R$ be nonzero and
  not a [[Unit|unit]]. We say that $p$ is _irreducible_ if its only
  [[Divisor|divisors]] are [[Unit|units]] and [[Associate|associates]].
- This has a special case for polynomials:
  - Let $f\in F[x]$ be nonzero and non-constant (i.e. $f$ is not a
    [[Unit|unit]]). We say that $f$ is _irreducible_ if its only factors
    (divisors) are [[Unit|units]] and [[Associate Polynomial|associates]].
