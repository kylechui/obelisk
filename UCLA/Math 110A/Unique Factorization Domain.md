- Let $R$ be an [[Integral Domain|integral domain]] We say $R$ is a _unique
  factorization domain_ if given a nonzero, non-[[Unit|unit]] $r\in R$, the
  following hold:
  - $r$ can be factored as a product of [[Irreducibility|irreducibles]], i.e.
    $r = p_1 \dotsb p_n$, where $p_i\in R$ are [[Irreducibility|irreducible]]
  - The factorization of $r$ is unique. If
    $r = p_1 \dotsb p_n = q_1 \dotsb q_m$, then $n = m$, and there exists some
    permutation $\sigma$ such that $p_i$ and $q_{\sigma(i)}$ are associates.
