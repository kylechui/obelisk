- Let $R$ be an [[Integral Domain|integral domain]]. We say $R$ satisfies the
  _ascending chain condition_ on [[Principal Ideal|principal ideals]] if
  whenever we have a chain of inclusions of [[Principal Ideal|principal ideals]]
  given by
  $$
    (a_1)\subseteq (a_2) \subseteq \dotsb,
  $$
  for $a_i\in R$, there is a positive integer $n$ such that for all $m\geq n$,
  we have $(a_m) = (a_n)$.
