- Let $R$ be a ring, and $I\subseteq R$ be nonempty. We say $I$ is an _ideal_ if
  $I$ is a [[Non-unital Rings|non-unital subring]] and has the following
  "absorbing" properties:
  - For $a\in I$ and $x\in R$, we have $ax, xa\in I$
- We say that ideals are non-unital, because if it contained 1 then it would
  just be the original ring $R$
