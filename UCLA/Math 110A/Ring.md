- A _nonempty_ set $R$ with two operations, $+$ and $\cdot$, such that for all
  $a, b, c\in R$, we have:
  - Closure under addition: $a + b\in R$
  - Associativity of addition: $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$
  - Commutativity of addition: $a + b = b + a$
  - Additive identity: There exists $0\in R$ such that $a + 0 = a$
  - Additive inverse: There exists $-a\in R$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$
  - Closure under multiplication: $a\cdot b\in R$
  - Associativity of multiplication: $a\cdot (b\cdot c) = (a\cdot b)\cdot c$
  - Distributivity: $a\cdot (b + c) = a\cdot b + a\cdot c$ and
    $(a + b)\cdot c = a\cdot c + b\cdot c$
  - Multiplicative identity: There exists $1\in R$ such that $a\cdot 1 = a$
