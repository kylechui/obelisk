  - Value: A variable stores a value and the value's type
  - Binding: How the variable is connected to its current value
  - Storage: The slot of memory that stores the value
  - Lifetime: The time frame over which the variable exists
  - Scope: When/where a variable is accessible
  - Mutability: Whether or not a variable's value can be changed
