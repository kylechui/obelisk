- Haskell is a statically typed language
  - The type of all variables can be figured out at _compile time_
  - It uses _type inference_ to infer the types of variables at compile time,
    even if the variables aren't specified
  - There is no implicit type conversion, so you will need to manually convert
    between types yourself
