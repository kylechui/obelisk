## RRSET: Set of Resource Records

- DNS stores _multiple values_ of the same name, class, and type in multiple RRs
- All the RRs with the same name, type, and class
  - Forms the basic unit of a DNS response

## DNS Over TCP vs. UDP

- Over TCP, we have a minimum of 2 RTTs to get a response
- Over UDP
  - If there is no loss, the message is received in 1 RTT
  - If no reply is received after some pre-determined time, another
    authoritative server from the RRset is queried
