- The process of running a set of programs carefully designed to measure some
  metric
  - In our case, we use it to measure [[CPU Time|CPU time]], which is an
    indication of [[Performance and Pipelining|performance]]
- Some use cases:
  - The architect: Prove that the new hardware is good
  - The marketer: Make us look better than the competition
  - The user: Use it as a heuristic for which processor is "better" than others
