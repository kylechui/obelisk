- There are three main levels of [[Abstractions|abstractions]] that we deal
  with:
  - High level language: Abstraction closer to the problem domain
  - Assembly language: Representation of instructions that is architecture
    independent
    - Defined based on the [[Instruction Set Architecture|ISA]]
  - Hardware representation: Bits encoding instructions and data
- This allows for flexibility for writing programs once, for multiple different
  implementations of the underlying hardware
