- The amount of time spent on computations (ignore IO/system/etc.)
- We can measure this by:
  - Directly running the program and measuring the elapsed time (too costly)
  - Simulate the processor (trade-off between accuracy and complexity)
- Since specific applications can bias our results, we run
