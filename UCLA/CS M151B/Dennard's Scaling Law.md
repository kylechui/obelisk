- Each transistor's area decreases to 50% (or each dimension to 70%)
  - This comes from the fact that $1/\sqrt{2}\approx 0.7$
- Some consequences are:
  - Voltage is reduced to 70%
  - Delays are reduced to 70%
  - Frequency is increased by 40%
  - Capacitance is reduced to 70%
  - Power consumption per transistor cut in half
    - Since we are doubling the transistors, the overall power consumption
      should remain roughly the same
