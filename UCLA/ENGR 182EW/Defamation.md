- The statement must be:
  - Harmful to the person's reputation

## Moderator's Dilemma

- CompuServe had zero content moderation, and so they weren't liable at all for
  any of the content that users produced (libel)
- Prodigy moderated content, and so they were liable for user-generated content
- [[Section 230]] protects content service providers from:
  - Liability for user-generated content (bad content posted)
  - Liability for curating user-generated content (blocking content)
  - The phrase "or otherwise objectionable" is unclear
- eBay was sued for providing items with forged signatures on their platform
  - Protected by [[Section 230]]
- Roommates.com was sued for putting questions on their sign-up regarding family
  status, gender, orientation
  - Not protected, because the company is making decisions for the users
    - Would be different if the users themselves were asking such questions
  - Violates the fair housing act
- Google sued for recommending videos on terrorism to those that looked for it
