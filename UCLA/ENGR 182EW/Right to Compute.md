- The [[First Amendment]] extends to other forms of speech, like painting,
  photography, music, etc.
- Noise ordinances don't violate the [[First Amendment]]
  - A noise ordinance for a specific genre of music would violate the
    [[First Amendment]]
- We have two big questions:
  - Is computer code expressive?
    - Yes, because it is a means for exchanging information/ideas about
      programming
  - Is the purpose of performing some computation expressive?
    - No, since once the software is running, the computations are purely
      functional
- There is robust debate regarding who should have the rights to works produced
  by generative AI
  - This means that those works inherently have some value

## Pro Regulation

- We do not want the premature development and unchecked deployment of large AI
  models
- Should not violate [[First Amendment]], because it would target computation
  and not expression
  - Any artists "caught in the crossfire" are just incidental

## Anti Regulation

- Limiting AI computation would impact expression, because one of the main
  purposes of generative AI is to produce prose/imagery/video/etc.
