- Protects freedom of:
  - Speech
  - Religion
  - Press
  - Assembly
  - Petitioning the government for grievances, e.g. recounting votes
- However, this only constrains _the government_, not
  companies/universities/etc.

## Exceptions

- Inciting lawless action
- Defamation: False statements meant to damage the reputation of someone
- True threats
- Targeted harassment
- Time/place/manner restrictions, e.g. noise complaints
- Copyright-protected ideas

## Case Study: Offensive Band Name

- The band tries to trademark their name, and USPTO rejects it on the grounds
  that the name is offensive
- Court rules that offensive speech is still lawful
