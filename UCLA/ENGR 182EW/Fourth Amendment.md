- The right to be secure in their persons, houses, paper and effects, against
  unreasonable search and seizures
  - In Britain, the Crown could use "general warrants" to go after political
    enemies, or "writs of assistance" to search for untaxed goods
  - Supports the notion that "a person's home is their castle" and the
    government cannot invade it
- To search you, the search/seizure must have a warrant of "probable cause"
  (certain level of suspicion of criminal activity) as justification
- Exclusionary rule: Evidence seized as part of an illegal search cannot be
  admitted into court
  - Has since been expanded to cases where the police violate the Fourth
    Amendment in "good faith"
    - This might occur if the law is unclear, or if the violation is only
      technical
- Policing has now become proactive instead of reactive, and tries to deter
  criminals over identifying and catching them
- Searches and seizures are reasonable if they are based on legislative
  authorization or pursuant to rules that have some form of democratic say in
  their making
  - Warrants should always be obtained before searches so an impartial judge can
    assess the need to intrude
  - We should distinguish between searches aimed at suspects and those aimed at
    society
- People are protected from group-based policing by the Equal Protection clause
  - Should usually be concerned with individuals, or everybody
