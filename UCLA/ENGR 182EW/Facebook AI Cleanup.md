- Internal documents leaked show that Facebook can't really do anything about it
  - Basically just single-digit performance for identifying content that breaks
    Facebook's terms of service
- It is basically impossible to have a model that captures even a majority of
  integrity harms
- Facebook tries to spin the narrative by focusing on "prevalence" of
  objectionable content, which represents what they missed and what people saw
  - They won't release how their studies were conducted
- The AI algorithms are pretty good with spam, but fall short in
  sensitive/controversial areas
- It also can't really do anything for non-English languages
