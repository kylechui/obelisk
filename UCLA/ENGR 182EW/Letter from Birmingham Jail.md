- MLK is jailed in Birmingham city jail
- He is receiving feedback from other clergymen calling his actions "unwise and
  untimely"
  - He responds by saying that he cannot ignore the injustices in Birmingham
    - "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere"

## Steps to a Non-Violent Campaign

- Collection of facts to determine whether injustices are alive
- Negotiation
- Self-purification
- Direct action

- Non-violent campaigning is necessary to gain civil rights
  - Individuals may yield their rights voluntarily, but groups will not
- There are just (moral + human) and unjust (immoral) laws
  - Segregatory laws are immoral and thus unjust
- The bystanders that are unwilling to help are the real challenge, not the
  hyper racist people
