- Antitrust exists to promote competition
- There are three main federal antitrust laws:
  - The Sherman Act: Outlaws all contracts that restrain interstate/foreign
    trade
  - The Clayton Act: Prohibits mergers/acquisitions that are likely to lessen
    competition
  - The Federal Trade Commission Act: Created the FTC (federal agency)
- The FTC and DOJ enforce antitrust laws
  - DOJ can make civil and criminal claims
- [[Primer on US v Google|Case Study: US v. Google]]

## Case Study: US v. Amazon

- Amazon argues that the market encompasses _all_ retail, not just online
  commerce
  - Over 80% of all products are still bought in physical stores

## Examples

- Two companies A and B offer the same product, but A's is better, at the same
  price
  - As a result, A gets 96% market share
  - Not anticompetitive
- Two gas station owners meet and decide to raise prices at the same time
  - Anticompetitive
- The bill of materials for a company A rises, and so they raise their prices
  - Company B bought in at the old prices, and raises their prices to just under
    company A's
  - Not anticompetitive
- Code of ethics contains the phrase "a member shall not knowingly compete with
  another member on the basis of professional charges"
  - Anticompetitive
- More anticompetitive behaviors: price fixing, group boycotts, exclusionary
  dealing contracts/trade association rules
  - Two broad categories:
    - Horizontal conduct: Agreements between competitors
    - Single firm conduct: Monopolization

## Exemptions to Antitrust

- Commerce clause: Gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign
  nations and among the states
  - Prohibits states from implementing trade barriers to protect in-state
    business
  - Ensures federal government has the sole authority to trade with foreign
    nations
