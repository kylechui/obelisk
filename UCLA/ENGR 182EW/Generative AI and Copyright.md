- GenAI programs are trained on large quantities of existing works

## Do AI Outputs Enjoy Copyright Protection?

- There is precedent to only extend copyright protection to human authors
- Works created by humans using GenAI could still get copyright protection,
  depending on how involved the human was in the creation of the work
  - Recent lawsuits determined that images made by GenAI are not copyrightable,
    since the author is not human
  - The human just gives the GenAI an idea, and the GenAI is the actual author
    of the work
- Another perspective is that GenAI is just a tool for humans to express their
  creativity
  - Counterpoint: GenAI creates things at random, and cannot be controlled in a
    predictable way
    - Hiring an artist and giving general directions

## Who Owns Copyright for GenAI Outputs?

- The prompter would likely hold the copyright
  - Other candidates include the creator of the GenAI

## Copyright Infringement by GenAI

- Training on public datasets may violate copyright protections of those pieces
  - Especially if the GenAI reproduces parts/whole of a work without
    modification
- AI companies may argue that training falls under fair use
  - OpenAI argues that the training is [[Fair Use|fair use]], because the usage
    is _transformative_, i.e. creating a good LLM
    - Cites a case where Google's copying of books into a searchable index was
      considered fair use
- Getty images sued Stability for using copyrighted images in training
  - Lowers market value of the original works, and it's for a commercial purpose
