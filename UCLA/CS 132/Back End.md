- The back end is language-agnostic, but architecture-specific
- It is responsible for:
  - Producing compact, fast code
  - Use available addressing modes
  - Pattern matching problem
- Register allocation:
  - Have a value in a register when used
  - Limited resources
  - Changes instruction choices
  - Can move loads and stores
  - Optimal allocation is difficult (analogous to graph coloring)
