- A construction that captures a fundamental pattern of relationships between
  objects in a [[Categories|category]] by describing a class of objects and
  arrows satisfying some property
  - The [[Terminal Object|terminal objects]] in this class are described as
    satisfying some "universal property"
  - These [[Terminal Object|terminal objects]] are unique up to
    [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]]
- If we consider tuples $(X, x_1, x_2)$, where $x_1\colon X\to A$
  $x_2\colon X\to B$, to be objects in a "category of wedges", then the terminal
  object is the product of $A$ and $B$
  - The [[Products|product object]] has the universal property of pairing
    together morphisms to $A$ and $B$
- In a sense, we can consider them the
