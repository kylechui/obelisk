- An arrow $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is considered an _isomorphism_ if there exists
  another arrow $f^{-1}$ from $B$ to $A$ such that $f\circ f^{-1} = id_A$ and
  $f^{-1}\circ f = id_B$
- Objects isomorphic to one another are essentially indistinguishable from the
  perspective of the category, since all arrows to/from one of them go to/from
  any of the others
