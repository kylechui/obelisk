- A partial ordering $\leq_P$ (sometimes the $P$ is omitted for brevity) is a
  reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric relation on the elements of $P$
  - Reflexive: $\forall p, p\leq p$
  - Transitive: $\forall p, q, r$, we have
    $p\leq q\land q\leq r\implies p\leq r$
  - Antisymmetric: $\forall p, q$, we have $p\leq q\land q\leq p\implies p = q$
