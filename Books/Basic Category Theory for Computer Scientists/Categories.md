- A category $C$ comprises of:
  - A collection of _objects_
  - A collection of _arrows_ (or _morphisms_)
  - Operations assigning to each arrow $f$ an object $dom\ f$ (its domain) and
    an object $cod\ f$ (its codomain)
    - We write $f\colon A\to B$ or $A\xrightarrow{\stackrel{f}{}} B$ to show
      that $dom\ f = A$ and $cod\ f = B$
  - Every object has an identity arrow
  - Arrow composition is associative
