Sometimes, putting in more hours doesn't lead to better results. The _quality_
of the work that you put in is incredibly important; one hour of working while
"in the zone" is much more productive than an entire workday spent distracted. A
corollary is that investing in your own health and well-being can go a long way
towards improving your overall productivity. For example, it's often a better
use of time to sleep and re-energize than it is to continue working into the
night.
