- Software development is [[Software Issues|plagued by issues]]
- NixOS is different from other distributions in that it is:
  - Declarative
    - This allows you to keep track of exactly what packages exist on your
      system
    - It also allows for the same system to be reproduced on multiple machines
  - Immutable-ish
  - Unbreakable
    - You can rollback to previous generations of NixOS if installing something
      breaks the system
